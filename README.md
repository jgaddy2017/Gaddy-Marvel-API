## Summary Section

To begin: on the top left you will find a character button. Clicking on this button will give you an A-Z index. Use this index to access a list of Marvel characters. Characters are listed by their first names.

Example: If you want information on Captain America, click on the "C" from the index. For easier accessibily, you can also click the letter on your keyboard.

These characters are being accessed from the Marvel API.

You will notice that the character button is disabled as soon as you get to the site, thereby enabling all characters to load in at one time. This ensures a smoother user experience. Loading Process will be shown.

The statistics and background of each character is accessed from the Super Hero API, so not all characters will have information.
